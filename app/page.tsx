                    Assessment of AI Maturity Model for Example Company:<br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <strong>Strategy and Vision:</strong> You mentioned AI is
                    strategic and well-funded in your organization, indicating a
                    clear vision and commitment. However, the actual integration
                    into production appears cautious. Stage: 3<br></br>
                    <strong>Data Management:</strong> Data quality is described as
                    just okay with notable noise, suggesting challenges in
                    leveraging data as a strategic asset fully. Stage: 2<br></br>
                    <strong>Technology and Infrastructure:</strong> Youâ€™re
                    leveraging major AIaaS and have experimented with models in
                    production, hosted on Databricks. This shows a good level of
                    technological readiness, though not yet fully optimized.
                    Stage: 3<br></br>
                    <strong>People and Culture:</strong> There is a dedicated
                    training program by AI specialists, which points to a strong
                    AI-adaptive workforce and an AI-ready culture. Stage: 4
                    <br></br>
                    Governance and Ethics: The presence of a change management
                    board suggests sound governance, though it also introduces
                    delays in AI solution delivery, indicating a focus on risk
                    management that could hinder agility. Stage: 3<br></br>
                    Performance and Scalability: Monitoring is done through
                    service provider dashboards, showing an awareness and active
                    management but perhaps not a full optimization or proprietary
                    monitoring solution in place yet. Stage: 3
